# Release Notes

## 2.8.3 - October 1, 2026

**🚀 New Features**

* feat(shm): Add a plugin-based shared memory data service; add the client/standalone shared-memory zero-copy K-line view, the K-line shared memory cache, IPC client-mode real-time update forwarding, and the base-info shared memory snapshot; in client mode, stock weights and historical finance data are now loaded lazily with local caching; the main process can pull K-lines directly from the quote cache server
* feat(gui): Add UI language selection with dynamic switching, and complete the English translation
* feat(i18n): Translate core C++/Python comments, docstrings and docs into English; add the English README, the Quick Start guide, the AI development guide (AGENTS.md) and a Chinese-English quant terminology glossary
* feat(slippage): Add the `seed` parameter for reproducible backtests; boundary handling for truncated normal rejection sampling; NaN validation for the NormalSlippage mean
* feat(plugin): ClickHouse/MySQL/HDF5 importers now support market and stock type registration; remove the market registration start-date parameter
* feat(data): Add a standalone auto-negotiated KData data service; `db_connect` adds `sqlStringLiteral` for safe SQL escaping; hkuextra client mode adds the `clearKDataCache` interface
* feat(hub): In non-Chinese environments, the default hub is cloned from GitHub by default
* refactor: Boost dependency requirement raised to 1.92.0


**⚡️ Improvements**

* perf(trade_manage): `getFundsList` now replays the trade list in one pass; add `getRefTradeList` to avoid copying the whole table on read-only access; fix margin/borrowing/asset accounting and duplicated dividend counting (#511)
* perf(trade_sys): Buyable quantity now uses binary search instead of per-lot decrement
* fix(trade_sys): Fix take-profit price mapping to unadjusted coordinates, the short stop-loss direction and exit check, and stop-loss/take-profit cache reset
* perf(indicator): The dynamic-parameter path uses scalar recursion instead of SLICE + rebuild
* fix(indicator): Unified fix for incremental calculation boundaries and out-of-bounds reads (ADJ_FACTOR/BACKSET/BARSSINCEN/ALIGN/SAFTYLOSS/ISLIMIT/QUANTILE_TRUNC/ATR/DIFF/REF/WMA/MACD/DMA/EXIST, etc.)
* fix(strategy): Fix order reference price, the sign and units of totalRisk, long-only continuous trading count, unified reserved-cash deduction in `can_allocate_cash`, per-training-window EV isolation in WalkForward, etc.
* fix(utilities): GlobalStealThreadPool switched to thread-local storage; fix move semantics and loading guards of MQStealQueue/ResourcePool/DllLoader/PluginLoader

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

* fix(data_driver): Fix cross-boundary aggregation of derived-period K-lines in the SQL backend, the Python custom KDataDriver `getIndexRangeByDate` returning `end` wrongly replaced by `start`, and the HDF5 date-index fallback logic; remove the redundant TMPCSV temporary mechanism
* fix(stock): Fix real-time update rejecting invalid K-line records and client-mode buffer gating; the shm client's daily auto-reload is delayed by 5 minutes
* fix(global): Fix the FlatBuffers validation range and the exception safety of parseFlatSpot/StockManager initialization
* fix(analysis): Fix null-pointer dereference for null tm/sys in the portfolio analysis entry, the date range and ending at the last trading day of the query; fix the Portfolio delayed sell-order removal condition and self-tm systems being retained in the WithoutAF selector pool
* refactor(clone): Simplify the clone implementation and strengthen subclass exception handling; System/Portfolio/WalkForward are now exception-safe
* fix(trade): Short broker orders now synchronize with the actual executed quantity
* fix(draw): The Avg Win/Avg Loss key of the payoff panel
* fix(stock): Improve the readability of parameter validation logs
